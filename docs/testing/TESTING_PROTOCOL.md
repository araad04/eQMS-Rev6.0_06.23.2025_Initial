## 2. Integration Testing

### Scope
End-to-end workflows between React components and Express.js backend

### Tools
- Vitest with API mocks
- Supertest for backend routes
- SQLite in-memory database for testing
- Playwright for browser automation

### Focus Areas

#### 2.1 CRUD Operations
- Document creation, read, update, delete
- CAPA lifecycle management
- User management
- Supplier qualification

#### 2.2 Workflow Testing
- Document approval chains
- CAPA assignment and closure
- Audit execution
- Corrective action tracking

#### 2.3 Security Testing
- Authentication flows
- Authorization checks
- Data encryption
- Audit trail integrity

### Test Matrix
Each feature includes:
- Happy path scenarios
- Error handling paths
- Edge cases
- Performance benchmarks

## 3. Verification Testing (Design Verification Phase)

### Scope
Conformance to input requirements (URS → DDS)

### Process
1. Develop test protocols per IEC 62304
2. Define clear acceptance criteria
3. Execute documented verification activities
4. Review and sign-off results

### Protocol Storage
- Protocols: `/docs/verifications/`
- Results: `/results/verifications/`
- Templates: `/templates/verification/`

### Verification Categories

#### 3.1 Functional Verification
- Feature completeness vs. URS
- User interface conformance
- Business rule implementation
- Data model validation

#### 3.2 Performance Verification
- Response time requirements
- Concurrent user limits
- Database performance
- File upload/download speeds

#### 3.3 Security Verification
- Access control mechanisms
- Data encryption verification
- Audit trail completeness
- Vulnerability assessment

## 4. Validation Testing (System Validation)

### Scope
Entire eQMSMD system under real-world usage scenarios

### Method
- Scenario-based validation against intended use
- Performance, usability, security, and compliance testing
- User acceptance testing with medical device professionals

### Validation Protocol: VMP-eQMS-VAL-001

#### 4.1 User Profile Simulation
- Quality Manager workflows
- Auditor responsibilities
- Document Controller tasks
- Regulatory Affairs processes

#### 4.2 Data Integrity Verification
- ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available)
- 21 CFR Part 11 compliance
- Audit trail validation
- Electronic signature verification

#### 4.3 Load Testing
- Concurrent user sessions
- Database performance under load
- File system stress testing
- Network latency simulation

#### 4.4 Compliance Testing
- ISO 13485:2016 requirements
- FDA 21 CFR Part 820 compliance
- IEC 62304 software lifecycle
- GDPR data protection

## 5. Result Archival and Protocol Mapping

### Traceability Matrix
One-to-one mapping:
URS → SRS → DDS → Test Case ID → Protocol ID → Result

### Digital Signature Requirements
- All test protocols require FDA Part 11-compliant e-signatures
- Signature metadata includes:
  - Digital hash of document
  - Timestamp (UTC)
  - User ID and role
  - Reason for signing
  - Change control reference

### Retention Policy
