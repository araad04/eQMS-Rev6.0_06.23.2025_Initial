# DHF Implementation Guide for eQMS Integration
## Cleanroom Environmental Control System (DP-2025-001)

### Overview
This implementation guide details how the DHF Index Specification integrates with the eQMS system to automatically aggregate and organize design history documentation for regulatory compliance with ISO 13485:2016 §7.3.10, 21 CFR §820.30(j), and IEC 62304.

## 1. eQMS MODULE INTEGRATION

### 1.1 Design Control Module Integration
The DHF system pulls design project data from the `design_projects` table where:
- **Project Code**: DP-2025-001 serves as the primary key for all DHF aggregation
- **Project Title**: "Cleanroom Environmental Control System" provides the product identification
- **Project Status**: Tracked through design phases (Planning → Design → Verification → Validation → Transfer)
- **Team Assignments**: Links to user management for design authority and responsibility tracking

### 1.2 Document Control Module Integration
All design outputs reference the document control system:
- **Document Types**: Technical specifications, drawings, procedures, protocols
- **Version Control**: Automatic versioning with approval workflows
- **Document Status**: Draft, Under Review, Approved, Obsolete tracking
- **Electronic Signatures**: 21 CFR Part 11 compliant approval processes
- **Access Control**: Role-based document access management

### 1.3 CAPA Module Integration
Design changes and corrective actions are tracked through:
- **Change Requests**: Linked to design change control processes
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Design-related failure investigations
- **Corrective Actions**: Design modifications and verification requirements
- **Preventive Actions**: Design improvements based on risk analysis
- **Effectiveness Reviews**: Verification of design change success

### 1.4 Audit Module Integration
Design control compliance verification through:
- **Internal Audits**: Design control process compliance checks
- **External Audits**: Regulatory inspection readiness
- **Audit Findings**: Design control non-conformances and corrections
- **Corrective Actions**: Audit-driven design process improvements
- **Management Review**: Design control effectiveness assessment

## 2. AUTOMATED DHF COMPILATION PROCESS

### 2.1 Data Aggregation Logic
The DHF compilation system automatically:

1. **Queries Design Project Data**
   ```
   SELECT * FROM design_projects WHERE project_code = 'DP-2025-001'
   ```

2. **Aggregates Related Documents**
   ```
   SELECT * FROM documents WHERE project_id = [project_id] 
   AND document_type IN ('specification', 'drawing', 'protocol', 'report')
   ```

3. **Collects CAPA Records**
   ```
   SELECT * FROM capas WHERE project_id = [project_id]
   OR description LIKE '%DP-2025-001%'
   ```

4. **Gathers Audit Evidence**
   ```
   SELECT * FROM audits WHERE project_id = [project_id]
   OR scope LIKE '%design control%'
   ```

### 2.2 DHF Structure Generation
The system automatically organizes collected data into:

#### Section 1: Design Plan
- Project overview from `design_projects` table
- Team assignments from user management
- Development methodology from project templates
- Risk classification from regulatory pathway data

#### Section 2: Design Inputs
- Requirements documents from document control
- Regulatory requirements from compliance templates
- Performance specifications from technical documents
- Safety requirements from risk management data

#### Section 3: Design Outputs

- Test data and statistical analysis
- Calibration records for test equipment

#### Section 5: Validation Records
- Installation Qualification (IQ) protocols
- Operational Qualification (OQ) protocols
- Performance Qualification (PQ) protocols
- Software validation for 21 CFR Part 11

#### Section 6: Design Reviews
- Phase gate review minutes and decisions
- Design review attendance and approvals
- Action item tracking and closure
- Regulatory consultation records

#### Section 7: Design Changes
- Change control records from CAPA system
- Impact assessments and approvals
- Verification of change implementation
- Updated documentation references

#### Section 8: Risk Management
- Risk analysis documentation
- Risk control measures and verification
- Risk management file references
- Post-market surveillance planning

#### Section 9: Design Transfer
- Manufacturing documentation packages
- Production readiness assessments
- Technology transfer protocols
- Commercial launch criteria
