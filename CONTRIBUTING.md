# Contributing to eQMS

## Overview

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the eQMS (Electronic Quality Management System). This document provides guidelines for contributing to our medical device quality management system while maintaining regulatory compliance and professional standards.

## Code of Conduct

### Professional Standards
- Maintain the highest level of professionalism in all interactions
- Respect regulatory compliance requirements
- Follow medical device industry best practices
- Ensure patient safety considerations in all contributions

### Regulatory Awareness
Contributors must understand and respect:
- ISO 13485:2016 Medical Device Quality Management
- 21 CFR Part 11 Electronic Records and Signatures
- IEC 62304 Medical Device Software Lifecycle
- EU MDR Medical Device Regulation

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.x LTS
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Git 2.34+
- Understanding of medical device regulations

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/eqms-medical-device-qms.git
cd eqms-medical-device-qms

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Configure your database connection
# Edit .env with your database credentials

# Push database schema
npm run db:push

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Issue Creation
Before starting work:
- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
- Use appropriate issue templates
- Clearly describe the problem or enhancement
- Include regulatory impact assessment
- Tag with appropriate labels

### 2. Branch Strategy
```bash
# Create feature branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Create fix branch for bugs
git checkout -b fix/bug-description

# Create compliance branch for regulatory updates
git checkout -b compliance/regulation-update
```

### 3. Development Guidelines

#### Code Standards
- **TypeScript**: Use strict type checking
- **ESLint**: Follow configured rules
- **Prettier**: Maintain consistent formatting
- **Comments**: Document complex regulatory logic
- **Testing**: Maintain >90% code coverage

#### Security Requirements
- Never commit sensitive data
- Validate all inputs
- Implement proper authentication
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Maintain audit trails

#### Compliance Considerations
- Document regulatory impact
- Maintain electronic signature integrity
- Preserve audit trail functionality
- Follow 21 CFR Part 11 requirements
- Ensure data integrity

### 4. Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- filename.test.ts
```

#### Integration Tests
- Test database interactions
- Verify API endpoints
- Check authentication flows
- Validate compliance features

#### Compliance Testing
- Audit trail verification
- Electronic signature validation
- Data integrity checks
- Performance testing

### 5. Pull Request Process

#### Before Submitting
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Compliance impact assessed
- [ ] Breaking changes documented

#### PR Description
Use the provided template and ensure:
- Clear description of changes
- Regulatory impact assessment
- Testing evidence
- Security considerations
- Documentation updates

#### Review Process
1. **Automated Checks**: CI/CD pipeline must pass
2. **Code Review**: At least one maintainer approval
3. **Security Review**: For security-related changes
4. **Compliance Review**: For regulatory-impacting changes
5. **Final Approval**: Project maintainer sign-off

## Development Guidelines
