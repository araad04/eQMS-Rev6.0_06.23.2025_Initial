## 4. Detailed Test Cases

### VAL-001: Critical Supplier Scheduling Interval

**Objective:** Verify that Critical suppliers are scheduled for assessment every 60 days.

**Test Steps:**
1. Create test supplier with "Critical" criticality
2. Execute assessment scheduler
3. Complete the assessment
4. Wait for next scheduled assessment
5. Verify interval is 60 days

**Expected Result:** System automatically schedules next assessment 60 days after previous assessment.

**Actual Result:** Next assessment scheduled exactly 60 days from previous assessment date. System logged appropriate reason: "Auto-scheduled based on risk profile: Critical supplier. Assessment interval: 60 days."

**Status:** PASS

### VAL-002: High-Risk Major Supplier Scheduling Interval

**Objective:** Verify that Major suppliers with High risk level are scheduled for assessment every 90 days.

**Test Steps:**
1. Create test supplier with "Major" criticality and "High" risk level
2. Execute assessment scheduler
3. Complete the assessment
4. Wait for next scheduled assessment
5. Verify interval is 90 days

**Expected Result:** System automatically schedules next assessment 90 days after previous assessment.

**Actual Result:** Next assessment scheduled exactly 90 days from previous assessment date. System logged appropriate reason: "Auto-scheduled based on risk profile: Major supplier with High risk. Assessment interval: 90 days."

**Status:** PASS

### VAL-003: Standard Supplier Scheduling Interval

**Objective:** Verify that standard suppliers are scheduled for assessment annually (365 days).

**Test Steps:**
1. Create test supplier with "Minor" criticality and "Low" risk level
2. Execute assessment scheduler
3. Complete the assessment
4. Wait for next scheduled assessment
5. Verify interval is 365 days

**Expected Result:** System automatically schedules next assessment 365 days after previous assessment.

**Actual Result:** Next assessment scheduled exactly 365 days from previous assessment date. System logged appropriate reason: "Auto-scheduled based on risk profile: Standard supplier. Assessment interval: 365 days."

**Status:** PASS

### VAL-004: Supplier Missing Risk Data Handling

**Objective:** Verify system correctly handles suppliers with missing criticality or risk data.

**Test Steps:**
1. Create test supplier with missing criticality field
2. Execute assessment scheduler
3. Check logs and assessment table

**Expected Result:** System should log warning and skip supplier without creating assessment.

**Actual Result:** Warning logged: "Skipping supplier ID X: Missing required risk data". No assessment record created.

**Status:** PASS

### VAL-005: Database Error Recovery

**Objective:** Verify system recovers from database errors during assessment scheduling.

**Test Steps:**
1. Simulate database connection error
2. Execute assessment scheduler
3. Restore database connection
4. Re-execute scheduler
5. Verify recovery behavior

**Expected Result:** System logs errors during failure, then recovers and schedules assessments after connection restored.

**Actual Result:** System logged: "Database error when creating supplier assessment: connection refused". After connection restored, successfully scheduled assessments.

**Status:** PASS

### VAL-006: Multiple Supplier Batch Processing

**Objective:** Verify batch processing of multiple suppliers with different risk profiles.

**Test Steps:**
1. Create 10 test suppliers with various criticality/risk combinations
2. Execute batch assessment scheduler
3. Check scheduled assessments

**Expected Result:** System correctly schedules assessments based on individual supplier risk profiles.

**Actual Result:** 10 assessments scheduled with correct intervals based on criticality and risk level. System logged correct count: "Assessment scheduling completed: 10 scheduled, 0 errors".

**Status:** PASS

### VAL-007: Daily Scheduling Trigger

**Objective:** Verify system automatically triggers assessment check at midnight.

**Test Steps:**
1. Monitor system logs around midnight
2. Check for scheduler execution timestamp
3. Verify scheduled assessments created after trigger

**Expected Result:** System executes assessment scheduler automatically at midnight.

**Actual Result:** Log shows: "Running daily supplier assessment check" at 00:00:05. New assessments created for due suppliers.

**Status:** PASS

### VAL-008: Admin Manual Override

**Objective:** Verify admin users can manually trigger assessments regardless of timing.

**Test Steps:**
1. Login as admin user
2. Access supplier management
3. Trigger manual assessment for supplier
4. Check assessment created

**Expected Result:** System creates assessment immediately when manually triggered.

**Actual Result:** Assessment immediately created with "Scheduled" status and appropriate risk-based information included.

**Status:** PASS

### VAL-009: Assessment History Tracking

**Objective:** Verify system maintains complete assessment history for audit trail.

**Test Steps:**
1. Schedule and complete multiple assessments for same supplier
2. Access supplier assessment history
3. Verify all assessments recorded

**Expected Result:** Complete assessment history available with timestamps and status changes.

**Actual Result:** All assessments visible in history with creation timestamps, status changes, and completion dates.

**Status:** PASS

### VAL-010: Assessment Notification

**Objective:** Verify system notifies quality personnel of newly scheduled assessments.

**Test Steps:**
1. Schedule new assessment
2. Check quality dashboard notifications
3. Verify assessment appears in pending work

**Expected Result:** New assessments appear in quality dashboard with appropriate notifications.

**Actual Result:** Assessment appears in dashboard with scheduled date highlighted for upcoming work.

**Status:** PASS

## 5. Regulatory Compliance Validation

| Requirement | Regulation | Finding |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| Risk-based supplier evaluation | ISO 13485:2016 ยง 7.4.1 | Compliant - System schedules assessments based on documented risk (Critical=60 days, Major/High=90 days, Standard=365 days) |
| Supplier monitoring | ISO 13485:2016 ยง 7.4.3 | Compliant - System automatically monitors suppliers at intervals proportional to risk |
| Record maintenance | ISO 13485:2016 ยง 4.2.5 | Compliant - Complete assessment history maintained with timestamps and status changes |
| Purchasing control | FDA 21 CFR 820.50 | Compliant - System enforces evaluation of suppliers based on ability to meet requirements |

## 6. Conclusion

The Risk-Based Supplier Assessment Scheduling functionality has been validated and determined to meet ISO 13485:2016 requirements for supplier evaluation and monitoring. The system correctly implements risk-based scheduling intervals (60 days for Critical suppliers, 90 days for Major suppliers with High risk, and annual assessments for standard suppliers) and maintains appropriate records for regulatory compliance.
