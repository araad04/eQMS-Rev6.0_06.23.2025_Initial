# Bug Fix: Approved Documents Not Appearing in Document Control Module (DOC005)

## Issue Summary
Documents with "Approved" status (statusId = 3) were not appearing in the Document Control module's main view after being approved through the document approval workflow.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by a mismatch between how the backend API returned document status information and how the frontend expected to receive it:

1. The backend was returning numeric `statusId` values (e.g., 3 for "Approved")
2. The frontend was expecting string status values (e.g., "APPROVED") 
3. There was no transformation happening in the API response to convert numeric IDs to string values

## Solution Implemented
The solution involved modifying the document API endpoints to transform the data before sending it to the frontend:

1. Updated the `/api/documents` endpoint to convert numeric `statusId` values to string status values that match the frontend's expectations
2. Added consistent mapping of other document properties (typeId, dates, etc.)
3. Ensured the same transformation logic is used in the pending documents endpoint

## Code Changes

### Modified Server Routes
- `server/routes.ts`: Updated the document API endpoints to transform database records into the format expected by the frontend
- Added mapping from numeric status IDs to string values:
  - statusId 1 → "DRAFT"
  - statusId 2 → "REVIEW"
  - statusId 3 → "APPROVED" 
  - statusId 4 → "EFFECTIVE"
  - statusId 5 → "OBSOLETE"

### Test Cases
- Created a test document with "Approved" status
- Verified the document appears in the API response with the correct status
- Created test case to validate the fix

## Verification
1. Created a test document with statusId = 3 (Approved)
2. Verified the API response includes this document with status "APPROVED"
3. Confirmed the document now appears in the Document Control view

## Future Considerations
1. Review other API endpoints that might need similar transformations
2. Consider adding data transformation layers consistently across the application
3. Add more comprehensive unit tests for API response formats

## Related Issues
- This fix ensures compliance with the document control test plan requirements (DCT-003)
- Improves usability for users needing to access approved documents
