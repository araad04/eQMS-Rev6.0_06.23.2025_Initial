# Supplier Assessment Scheduler - Verification and Validation Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the verification and validation approach for the Risk-Based Supplier Assessment Scheduling functionality. The system automatically schedules assessments based on supplier criticality and risk levels in compliance with ISO 13485:2016 requirements for supplier evaluation.

## 2. Verification Activities

### 2.1 Unit Testing

| ID | Test Name | Description | Success Criteria |
|----|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| UT-01 | Schedule Critical Supplier | Test scheduling for Critical suppliers (60-day interval) | Verify assessment scheduled with correct interval and risk reason |
| UT-02 | Schedule Major High-Risk Supplier | Test scheduling for Major suppliers with High risk (90-day interval) | Verify assessment scheduled with correct interval and risk reason |
| UT-03 | Standard Supplier Scheduling | Test scheduling for standard suppliers (annual interval) | Verify assessment scheduled with correct interval |
| UT-04 | Supplier Not Found | Test error handling when supplier ID is invalid | Function returns false with appropriate error logging |
| UT-05 | DB Error Handling | Test error handling when database operation fails | Function recovers gracefully with appropriate error logging |
| UT-06 | Batch Assessment Check | Test checking and scheduling multiple suppliers | All assessments scheduled correctly with accurate count |
| UT-07 | Empty Supplier List | Test batch scheduling with empty supplier list | Function handles empty list with warning |
| UT-08 | Scheduler Initialization | Test initialization with suppliers present | Scheduler starts correctly and logs status |
| UT-09 | No Suppliers Initialization | Test initialization with no suppliers | Scheduler detects no suppliers and logs warning |

### 2.2 Integration Testing

| ID | Test Name | Description | Success Criteria |
|----|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| IT-01 | API Assessment Retrieval | Test /api/supplier-assessments endpoint | Returns correctly formatted assessments with supplier names |
| IT-02 | Assessment Creation | Test creating assessment via API | Assessment created with correct data |
| IT-03 | Trigger Assessment | Test manual assessment triggering via API | Assessment scheduled based on supplier risk profile |
| IT-04 | Admin Batch Scheduling | Test batch scheduling via admin API | All needed assessments scheduled with correct count reported |
| IT-05 | Scheduler Status | Test scheduler status endpoint | Returns accurate counts and upcoming assessments |
| IT-06 | Error Handling | Test error scenarios in all API endpoints | All error conditions return appropriate status codes and messages |

### 2.3 System Testing

| ID | Test Name | Description | Success Criteria |
|----|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| ST-01 | Server Startup | Test scheduler initialization during server startup | Scheduler properly initializes with status logging |
| ST-02 | Daily Scheduling | Test daily midnight trigger for assessment checks | Scheduled assessments created for qualified suppliers |
| ST-03 | Database Connectivity | Test system behavior during database connectivity issues | System recovers when database connection restores |
| ST-04 | Stress Test | Test with 1000+ suppliers | System maintains performance with large supplier base |
| ST-05 | Persistence | Test data persistence after system restart | Scheduled assessments persist through restarts |

## 3. Validation Activities

### 3.1 User Acceptance Testing

| ID | Test Description | User | Expected Result |
|----|------------------|------|----------------|
| UAT-01 | Quality Manager views scheduled assessments for critical suppliers | Quality Manager | Can view all scheduled assessments with correct risk profiles |
| UAT-02 | Admin user manually triggers assessment for specific supplier | Admin | Assessment correctly scheduled with appropriate interval |
| UAT-03 | Quality Manager approves scheduling intervals (60/90/365 days) | Quality Manager | Confirms intervals match quality policy requirements |
| UAT-04 | Supplier Manager reviews assessment history | Supplier Manager | Can view complete history of scheduled and completed assessments |

### 3.2 Regulatory Compliance Validation

| ID | Requirement | Regulation | Validation Method |
|----|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| RCV-01 | Risk-based supplier evaluation | ISO 13485:2016 ยง 7.4.1 | Verify critical suppliers assessed every 60 days |
| RCV-02 | Supplier monitoring | ISO 13485:2016 ยง 7.4.3 | Verify monitoring frequency correlates with supplier risk |
| RCV-03 | Record maintenance | ISO 13485:2016 ยง 4.2.5 | Verify assessment records maintained with accurate timestamps |
| RCV-04 | Quality management system | FDA 21 CFR 820.50 | Verify system meets purchasing control requirements |

## 4. Traceability Matrix
