# IEC 62304 Compliance Documentation

**Document ID:** IEC62304-COMPLIANCE-001  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025-05-15  
**Safety Classification:** Class B (per IEC 62304)

## 1. Overview

This document provides evidence of compliance with IEC 62304:2006+AMD1:2015 "Medical device software â€” Software life cycle processes" for the electronic Quality Management System (eQMS) automated testing framework. It details how our test processes and documentation satisfy the requirements specified in the standard, particularly focusing on sections 5.5 (Software Unit Verification), 5.6 (Software Integration and Integration Testing), and 5.7 (Software System Testing).

## 2. Test Framework Architecture

The IEC 62304 compliant test framework is composed of the following components:

1. **Test Framework (`iec62304-test-framework.ts`):** Enforces compliance with IEC 62304 by requiring documentation of requirements, risk level, and test type for all tests.

2. **Module-Specific Test Suites:** Each module has its own test suite that validates functionality against documented requirements.

3. **Automated Test Runner (`run-tests.sh`):** Executes all tests at regular intervals and generates traceability reports.

4. **Test Scheduler (`crontab-setup.sh`):** Ensures tests run automatically every 15 minutes, providing continuous validation of software functionality.

## 3. IEC 62304 Requirements Coverage

### 3.1 Software Development Planning (Section 5.1)

- **Test Framework Documentation:** Each test module includes documentation headers with version, safety classification, and traceability to requirements.
- **Risk Classification:** Tests are classified according to potential risk (Class A, B, or C) as required by 5.1.7.

### 3.2 Software Requirements Analysis (Section 5.2)

- **Requirements Traceability:** Each test references specific requirement IDs (e.g., REQ-SUPP-001) to ensure full coverage.
- **Risk Control Verification:** Tests for risk control measures are explicitly marked and documented.

### 3.3 Software Unit Verification (Section 5.5)

The test framework satisfies IEC 62304 Section 5.5 as follows:

| IEC 62304 Requirement | Implementation |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| 5.5.1 - Define verification process | Test framework enforces documentation of test type and verification method |
| 5.5.2 - Acceptance criteria | Each test specifies expected results and passes only when criteria are met |
| 5.5.3 - Test unit structure | Tests are organized by module, component, and function |
| 5.5.4 - Additional verification | Boundary testing and error handling tests are included |
| 5.5.5 - Document verification | Test reports are automatically generated with timestamps and results |

### 3.4 Software Integration and Integration Testing (Section 5.6)

Integration tests are implemented to verify that:

- Components interact correctly
- External dependencies function as expected
- Error handling works across component boundaries

### 3.5 Software System Testing (Section 5.7)

System tests validate that:

- The system meets specified requirements
- The software works correctly in the intended operating environment
- Risk control measures are effective

### 3.6 Traceability (Section 5.1.1)

- Each test is linked to a specific requirement
- Test results are recorded and timestamped
- All verification activities create an audit trail

## 4. Test Execution Process

The automated testing process operates as follows:

1. Tests run automatically every 15 minutes
2. Test results are logged with timestamps
3. HTML reports are generated for human review
4. Failed tests trigger notification processes
5. Test coverage reports are generated to identify gaps

## 5. Risk Management

Our test framework implements risk management as required by IEC 62304:

1. Software is classified as Safety Class B (non-serious injury possible)
2. Risk control measures are explicitly tested
3. Tests for critical functionality are prioritized
4. Error cases and boundary conditions are systematically tested

## 6. Test Documentation

The test framework produces the following documentation artifacts that satisfy IEC 62304 requirements:

1. Test logs with timestamps and execution details
2. Test reports with pass/fail status
3. Coverage reports showing requirements traceability
4. Error notifications for failed tests

## 7. Maintenance and Updates

As part of the software maintenance plan required by IEC 62304 Section 6:

1. Tests are reviewed when requirements change
2. New tests are added for new functionality
3. Test framework is versioned and changes are documented
4. Test results are retained for regulatory purposes

## 8. Conclusion

The implemented test framework and process meet the requirements of IEC 62304:2006+AMD1:2015 for medical device software. By using this framework, we ensure that software verification is systematic, documented, and traceable, which is essential for regulatory compliance.
