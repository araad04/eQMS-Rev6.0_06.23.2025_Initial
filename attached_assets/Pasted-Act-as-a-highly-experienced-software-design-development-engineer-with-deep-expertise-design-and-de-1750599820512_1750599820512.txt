Change Request Prompt — eQMS Design Module Refactor
Title:
Refactor Design Module Architecture to Enable Dynamic Design Plan-Driven Workflow with Phase-Gated Progression
Description:
Initiate a complete reconstruction of the Design Control Module to implement a dynamic, project-specific Design Plan Submodule that acts as the operational driver and gatekeeper for all design activities. This submodule shall steer the project lifecycle, enforce regulatory checkpoints, and ensure coherence between inputs, outputs, verifications, and validations.
 
📌 Change Objectives
•	Introduce a new Design Plan Submodule that orchestrates all phases of the design process.
•	Ensure progression through phases is gated by phase review approvals, tracked in the Design Plan.
•	Populate Design Inputs, Outputs, Verification, and Validation contextually and traceably as the project evolves.
•	Enforce bi-directional traceability across all design artifacts.
•	Comply with:
o	FDA 21 CFR 820.30 (Design Controls)
o	ISO 13485:2016, Clause 7.3
o	IEC 62304 traceability and review checkpoints
 
🔄 Scope of Implementation
•	Frontend
o	Add new UI for Design Plan Dashboard with:
	Phase summary & progress indicators
	Review gating controls
	Linked components to Design Inputs, Outputs, V&V pages
o	Update Design Project Detail Page to integrate the new plan structure
•	Backend
o	Extend data models:
	design_phases, phase_reviews, gating_status, trace_links
o	Enforce business logic:
	Block next-phase activation until review outcome = approved
	Link CRUD operations in Inputs/Outputs/Verifications/Validations to specific phases
•	Database
o	Add tables:
	design_phase_reviews (id, phase_id, reviewer_id, outcome, comments, date_signed)
	traceability_links (source_type, source_id, target_type, target_id, justification)
o	Modify design_projects to include current_phase_id
•	Audit & Compliance
o	Implement full audit trail for:
	Phase transitions
	Review decisions and signatures
	Traceability matrix auto-generation per project
 
🧠 Expected Behavior
•	Upon project creation, a Design Plan template is initialized with defined phases.
•	Each phase defines:
o	Entry/exit criteria
o	Deliverables (e.g., Inputs, Outputs)
o	Phase review approval requirement
•	Submodules (Inputs, Outputs, V&V) become editable only within their active phase.
•	Phase review (w/ electronic signature) is required to unlock the next phase.
•	Traceability matrix auto-updates with every new artifact added and links established.
 
📅 Timeline
•	Sprint 1: Backend schema & APIs (Design Plan + Phase Gating)
•	Sprint 2: Frontend integration (UI components, phase control dashboard)
•	Sprint 3: Submodule updates (linking logic, editable state)
•	Sprint 4: Testing, validation (unit tests, traceability demo), documentation
 
✅ Acceptance Criteria
•	✅ Design Plan can be created, edited, and updated per project
•	✅ Design Inputs, Outputs, V&V link to plan and show traceability
•	✅ Phase cannot be advanced until signed review is completed
•	✅ Automated traceability matrix shows real-time linked data
•	✅ Full audit trail of all changes, reviews, and traceability actions
